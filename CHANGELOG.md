## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish/tree/v1.4.0) (2020-10-02)

- Added support NPM's `--tag` argument, which allows packages to be published to a named tag that can then be installed using `npm install <package-name>@<tag>`

- Added support for NPM's `--access` argument, which controls whether scoped packages are publicly accessible, or restricted to members of your NPM organization

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish/tree/v1.3.0) (2020-10-01)

- NPM-Publish can now successfully publish a brand-new package to NPM. Previously it failed because it couldn't determine the previous package version. ([PR #12](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish/pull/12) from [@ZitRos](https://github.com/ZitRos))

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish/tree/v1.2.0) (2020-07-23)

- Added support for running NPM in "dry run" mode, which doesn't actually publish, but reports details of what _would_ have been published.

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish/tree/v1.1.0) (2020-03-29)

- FIX: The configured NPM registry and token are now used _all_ NPM commands, not just for publishing. This ensures that npm-publish works with private packages and custom registries
