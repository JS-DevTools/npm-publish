## Features

- üß† **Smart**<br>
  Only publishes if the version number in `package.json` differs from the latest on NPM

- üõ† **Configurable**<br>
  Customize the version-checking behavior, the registry URL, and path of your package

- üîê **Secure**<br>
  Keeps your NPM access token secret. Doesn't write it to `~/.npmrc`

- ‚ö° **Fast**<br>
  100% JavaScript (which is faster than Docker) and bundled to optimize loading time

- üì§ **Outputs**<br>
  Exposes the old and new version numbers, and the type of change (major, minor, patch, etc.) as variables that you can use in your workflow.

## Usage

This package can be used three different ways:

- ü§ñ A [**GitHub Action**](#github-action) as part of your CI/CD process

- üß© A [**function**](#javascript-function) that you call in your JavaScript code

- üñ• A [**CLI**](#command-line-interface) that you run in your terminal

## GitHub Action

To use the GitHub Action, you'll need to add it as a step in your [Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions). By default, the only thing you need to do is set the `token` parameter to your [NPM auth token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens).

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      - uses: bluecargo/npm-publish@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

## Input Parameters

You can set any or all of the following input parameters:

|Name                  |Type     |Default                     |Description
|----------------------|-------- |----------------------------|------------------------------------
|`token`               |string   |**required**                |The NPM auth token to use for publishing
|`registry`            |string   |https://registry.npmjs.org/ |The NPM registry URL to use
|`package`             |string   |./package.json              |The path of your package.json file
|`tag`                 |string   |"latest"                    |The tag to publish to. This allows people to install the package using `npm install <package-name>@<tag>`.
|`access`              |string   |"public" for non-scoped packages. "restricted" for scoped packages.|Determines whether the published package should be publicly visible, or restricted to members of your NPM organization.
|`dry-run`             |boolean  |false                       |Run NPM publish with the `--dry-run` flag to prevent publication
|`check-version`       |boolean  |true                        |Only publish to NPM if the version number in `package.json` differs from the latest on NPM
|`greater-version-only`|boolean  |false                       |Only publish to NPM if the version number in `package.json` is greater than the latest on NPM                           |


## Output Variables

npm-publish writes env variables, which you can use in later steps of your workflow. 

```yaml
steps:
  - id: publish
    uses: bluecargo/npm-publish@v2
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

  - run: |
      echo "Version changed: ${{ env.old-version }} => ${{ env.version }}"
```

## JavaScript Function

To use npm-package in your JavaScript code, you'll need to install it using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):

```bash
npm install @jsdevtools/npm-publish
```

You can then import it and use it in your code like this:

```javascript
const npmPublish = require("@jsdevtools/npm-publish");

// Run npm-publish with all defaults
await npmPublish();

// Run npm-publish with options
await npmPublish({
  package: "./path/to/package.json",
  token: "YOUR_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE",
});
```

## Command Line Interface

To use npm-package from as a command-line tool in your terminal, you'll need to install it globally using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/):

```bash
npm install -g @jsdevtools/npm-publish
```

You can then use it in your terminal or in Bash scripts. You can call it without any arguments, and it will publish the current directory using NPM's default credentials.

```bash
npm-publish
```

Or you can call it with arguments to explicitly set the NPM auth token, registry, package path, etc.

```bash
npm-publish --token=YOUR_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE ./path/to/package.json
```

### Options

Run `npm-publish --help` to see the full list of options available.

```

options:
  --token <token>     The NPM access token to use when publishing

                      "restricted" = The package will only be visible to members
                      of your NPM organization.

  --dry-run           Don't actually publish to NPM, but report what would have
                      been published

  --debug, -d         Enable debug mode, with increased logging

  --quiet, -q         Suppress unnecessary output
